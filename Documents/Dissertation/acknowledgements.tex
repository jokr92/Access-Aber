I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Myra Wilson, for her invaluable technical and moral support during the duration of this project.

I would also like to thank Dr. Edel Sherratt for her continuous support during the entirety of my MSc degree. She has helped me resolve a wide array of issues -- many of which were not insignificant.

I would also like to thank Stefan Klaus MSc for helping me structure this document and make sure that it complies with the requirements set for MSc dissertations.

And finally: I would like to thank Dr. Angharad Shaw for visiting my high school back in Norway and recruiting me to Aberystwyth University.
She has not been directly involved in this project, but as she is the reason why I applied for my BSc, I recognise that I would not be where I am today without her.
