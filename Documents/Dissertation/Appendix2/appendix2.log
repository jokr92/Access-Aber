! LaTeX Error: The font size command \normalsize is not defined:
               there is probably something wrong with the class file.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.

                 {Example of top-level test-class}
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
